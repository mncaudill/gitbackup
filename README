This is a simple script that aids in keeping all your local branches in
sync with a namespaced refs folder.

By default, a git repository serves its public branches from
refs/heads, but git also allows you to push to any directory in the
git repository. This allows you to backup all of your local branches
to a "ref/<username>" directory, which gives the remote developer some
redundancy (as all local branches are pushed), but without having to
make them public and shared.

The script takes one argument: the remote ref directory.

An example, using myself would be:

     gitbackup refs/mncaudill

It first does a push of everything in the local refs/heads, to
refs/mncaudill on the origin (origin by default, but plans to change
this in the future), and then uses git's plumbing to get a list of all
local branches, does a 'git ls-remote' to find all the pushed branches,
finds any branches that exist remotely but not locally and removes them.

One tip is to add an alias to your .bashrc to save typing. My .bashrc
line looks like the following:

    alias gitbackup="gitbackup refs/mncaudill"

And please note the "AS-IS" portion of the MIT license. This works for
me and it will probably work for you, but that's about all I can say
about it.
